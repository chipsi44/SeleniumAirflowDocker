## Why I am making this tutorial?


<!---


Not bad, but here is an alternative. 

Many tutorials I found on this topic were outdated and the documentation of each of these tools are very broad. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a working pipeline that can be adapted and/or reused for other projects.  

You can see an example: #Add your optimization project here.

As a data engineer, I found myself needing to work with these three major technologies quickly, and I realized that most of the tutorials were outdated. So, I decided to create my own tutorial, as we all know that it can be challenging to learn solely by going through official documentation. 

<!---

State clearly, the challenge the tutorial is trying to address. Maybe with an example.

For example, we would like to integrate this three tools to build an automated scheduled scrapper for dynamic websites that can be deployed on the cloud. (You can adapt this)

## Structure of the repo

- Main Branch: Here you will find the instructions to follow to complete the tutorial.
- Corrected tuto: Here you'll find the completed tutorial. 

If you get stuck at any point in the tutorial, feel free to switch to the ['Corrected_tuto'](https://github.com/chipsi44/SeleniumAirflowDocker/tree/Corrected_Tuto) branch for assistance and to find more information on how these three technologies work together.

## Let's start

1. First of all, fork the repository so that you can work on it easily!
2. Create your virtual environment
3. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
4. In the first folder, you will find the tutorial. Follow each step in numerical order.
