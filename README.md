__Airflow version : 2.5.1 | Tuto made in March 2023__

* Repository : SeleniumAirflowDocker
* Type of challenge : Learning
* Duration : 5 days
* Team challenge : Individual

# Mission objectives

* Learning the basics of Airflow

# Structure of the project

In the main branch, you'll find an incomplete tutorial that you'll need to complete on your own.

There is a 'Corrected_tuto' branch where you'll find the completed tutorial. However, if you get stuck at any point in the tutorial, feel free to switch to the 'Corrected_tuto' branch for assistance.
For those looking to make these technologies work together without completing the tutorial, you can switch to the ['corrected_tuto'](https://github.com/chipsi44/SeleniumAirflowDocker/tree/Corrected_Tuto) branch. In the README file, you will find more information on how these three technologies work together.

# Let's start

* First of all, fork the repository so that you can work on it easily!
* Create your virtual environment
* Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
* In the first folder, you will find the tutorial. Follow each step in numerical order.

# Why making this project
"As a data scientist, I found myself needing to work with these three major technologies quickly, and I realized that most of the tutorials were outdated. So, I decided to create my own tutorial, as we all know that it can be challenging to learn solely by going through official documentation. If you do not wish to complete the tutorial but instead read about how these technologies work together, you can switch to the ['corrected_tuto'](https://github.com/chipsi44/SeleniumAirflowDocker/tree/Corrected_Tuto) branch.
